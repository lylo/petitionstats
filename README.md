# Article 50 Petition Stats

There is currently a petition running in the UK to [Revoke Article 50 and remain in the EU](https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/241584). I was interested to know which countries these votes were coming from. You can see the data below, which is based on the [official data feed](https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/241584.json).

I plan to make this app work for all petitions next.
